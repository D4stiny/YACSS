# YACSS
Yet Another Code-Sharing Service

# About
Hello, this software is about allowing multiple users to work on code together by simply remembering one-word which will be their room name. Rooms are accessible at HOST/roomname. Rooms can be accessed by anyone that has the room name. One of the biggest features is the ability to compile Python code, in this case the HOST runs and returns the output to the client. There is no virtualization or protection at this time to protect against malicious Python code.

This project was primarly developed by Bill Demirkapi (HTML, Javascript, CSS, and most of the Python Backend) while some credit is due to Max Ellsworth (for designing and creating the backend side of the compilation system), and finally Nikhil Singh deserves some credit for moral support.

This project was made for the MIT Blueprint competition in 2017.
